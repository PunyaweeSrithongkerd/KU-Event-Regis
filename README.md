## Description

an application that has a list of the upcoming events at Kasetsart University to help the user to choose and sign-up for events easier. The event list provides a location, date(s), durations and description for each event. This application can be used by anyone at Kasetsart University and optionally by outsiders if the event allows outside participation.
